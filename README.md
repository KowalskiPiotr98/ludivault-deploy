To see a specific way of deploying Ludivault, please check the relevant directory in this repository.

Please remember that tags/versions in this repository relate only to the deployment files.
This is relevant as the images use the `latest` tag.
The result is that when a new version of the image is released, this repository is not changed and tagged in any way.
The only situation when a new tag for this repository will be made is when the deployment files themselves change (for example when a new config value is added to the image and needs to be added to a docker compose file).

> [!NOTE]
> This repository only contains the deployment files. To see source, go to [frontend](https://github.com/KowalskiPiotr98/ludivault-web) or [backend](https://github.com/KowalskiPiotr98/ludivault-api) repos.
